# Odin Sign-Up Form

This is my attempt at Project: [Sign-Up Form](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-intermediate-html-and-css-sign-up-form), the first of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/)'s Intermediate HTML and CSS Course projects.

It is a basic HTML form. I also made it somewhat responsive and implemented some simple client-side validation with JavaScript.

## Skills demonstrated in this project

*  HTML forms.
*  CSS (Grid, Flex, Advanced selectors, Functions, Variables...).
* [Live page](https://nonines.github.io/Odin-Sign-Up-Form/)
